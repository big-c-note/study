# Essential Workflow Tips for Python Developers in Order of Set Up.

1. Use virtual environments [1], or containers [2], make installs obvious & secure.
2. Learn your text editor well.
``` bash
# I use vim [3].
```
3. Use a linter and a fixer.
``` bash
# I use `flake8` [4], `mypy` [5]
# I use `black` [6]
```
4. Use type annotations [7], [8], [9].
5. Functional Programming FTW / OOP sometimes makes sense [10].
6. Write clear doc strings. Documentation as code. [11]
7. Test driven development [12].
8. Write clear variable names.
9. Use a debugger [13].
10. Study algorithms [14].
11. Embrace regex [15]!
12. Use Github Copilot [16] and Chatgpt [17].
